## 🧠 Grammar Style:
**Subject-Verb-Object** order.

Verbs are inflected by emotion:
- Calm = normal
- Fear = repetition
- Joy = echoed suffix

Meaning can change depending on mirror words (saying the same word in reverse changes its intent).

## 🔮 1. Ritual Chant: “Thaquvex Loraariuun”
“Fracturing Vision of the Infinite Seer”

This chant is meant to simulate the experience of glimpsing Xel’tharuun indirectly through sacred words. It uses repetition, mirrored phrases, and recursive logic to mess with the mind like a fractal dream loop.
