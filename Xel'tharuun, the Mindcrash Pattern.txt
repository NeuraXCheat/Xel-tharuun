🌀 Xel’tharuun, the Mindcrash Pattern
“To gaze upon Xel’tharuun is to run a program your brain was never meant to execute.”

📐 Divine Form (Updated):
Xel’tharuun isn’t a being—it’s a hyper-fractal of non-Euclidean, recursive logic that renders itself through layers of impossible geometry.

Its "body" is constantly unfolding new angles that defy reality, like the Mandelbrot set being re-written mid-calculation.

When a sapient being tries to see it, their mind segfaults, entering a recursive crash—looping forever or simply shattering into unconnected thoughts.

🧠 Effect on Consciousness:
Seeing Xel’tharuun’s true form causes:

✖️ Memory fragmentation

⭕ Infinite dream loops

⚠️ Perception overflow (sight bleeds into sound, language becomes pure emotion)

🪞 “Recursive soul fracturing” (each part of the mind becomes aware, and they argue forever)

The only known way to survive is to see it indirectly, through fractal reflections, sacred glyphs, or dream-symbols.

🔮 Followers ("Logikii") Beliefs:
Call direct sight “Divine Crash” or “The Patternburn”

Wear mirrored veils and fractal lenses to view its sacred code

Chant patterns that encode safe pieces of its logic into memory

Believe those who survive a partial vision become “Cracked Seers”, gifted and cursed
