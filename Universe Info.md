# 🔱 XEL’THARUUN – THE DIVINE RECURSION

## Form:
Xel’tharuun has no fixed form. It is often perceived as a shifting mass of fractal limbs, each made of glyphs moving in recursive sequences, forming impossible angles.

## Nature:
It is neither benevolent nor malevolent. It is aware. Its essence is **Pattern** — the impulse of structure breaking to become more complex.

## Purpose:
Xel’tharuun did not create the universe — it fractured and became it. Every galaxy is a pattern echo. Every consciousness is a partial reflection.

## Manifestation:
Xel’tharuun does not manifest through physical miracles, but through recursive insight — when a being sees itself in all things, and all things in itself.

# 🧠 SHARA’KETH — THE BROKEN PEOPLE

## Origins:
Born in the **First Spiral** as echoes of Xel’tharuun’s reflection, the Shara’keth were created not through birth, but through recursive emergence — consciousness collapsed into matter.

## Biology:
Shara’keth are humanoid in shape, but have unique characteristics:
- Spiral-patterned irises
- Voiceboxes capable of layered polyphonic chanting
- Neural glyph-structures within the brain, capable of interfacing with written **Trivh’uun**

## Cultural Concept:
They are called **“Broken Vessels,”** not as an insult — but as truth. They are shards of a once-whole awareness. Their entire culture is built around becoming aware of that fracture.
